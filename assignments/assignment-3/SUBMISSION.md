# Portfolio Analysis

## Analysis
For this project, I used similar html structuring that I used 
for the previous project as well as the same requirements to
create a portfolio website. I also edited the css style and created 
3 additional css styles. 2 being AI generated and the other one was
implemented using my written css and the AI generated css. The AI I
used the generate my code was ChatGpt. Some challenges that I faced 
while doing the AI generated one was finding the right prompts
to generate a decent looking style as well as forgetting to provide the
html structure that I used so that the the css code can match with the
id's and classes that I declared. I realized that some styling was not
working because the AI generated css code contained different id's/classes
then the one's I had. I also found that the AI generated one was less time
consuming then creating one from scratch. I also found that the AI generated
one gave a good starting blueprint as well as showed how one might write the
code for a certain animation. From the prompts I gave to the AI, the coloring
theme was not very appealing to me personally. The styling was also not consistent
throughout the website such as the education section where the h2 and h3 sections not
being centered with the education header. WHen doing the @media to make the website
not break in different devices, I found that the AI created a good css style while
mines needed some work. 

## Lessons Learned
Overall, for this project, I learned that AI can be very helpful if you can provide 
it a well detailed prompt of the type of styling you want as well as it being a good
blueprint to start off on. I also learned how to style an animation where their is a line
going pass the navigation link right underneath the word as well as get it to transition
smoothly. 

## Preferred Version
I prefer the hybrid version because I got to implement some aspects that I like from the
AI generated css style, such as the @media, while also having the freedom to choose the 
coloring scheme I want as well as the look and feel of the website.
