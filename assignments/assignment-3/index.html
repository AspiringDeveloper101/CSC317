            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>I am an aspiring game developer who have demonstrated skills in active listening, information gathering, attention to details, editing documents, and the desire to learn. I originally got my AS in Computer Science degree at Canada College, which is located in Redwood City, CA, and then transferred to San Francisco State University. I am expected to graduate from there in Spring of 2026. I specialize in the Java language and am familiar with HTML5. I also have a bit of experience with git and git bash. I was also given a great opportunity to learn DevOps while also getting paid through a company called Revature.</p>
