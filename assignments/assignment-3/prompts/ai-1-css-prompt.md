Hello. Can you please create a CSS file for a portfolio website for a professional game developer? Please include a navigation bar, header or intro section, an about me section. an education section, a projects section, a contact form, and a footer. The theme should be video game related with colors and styles that remind people of a zombie survival game. Also make the website layout responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens and add helpful comments that explain what the different parts of the css do. I would also like easy to read fonts with some simple hover effects on buttons and links. There should also be reasonable spacing between the elements. Please do not include any images.
