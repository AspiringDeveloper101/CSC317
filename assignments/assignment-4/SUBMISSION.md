## Implementation
How I implemented the calculator was first building the structure of it using html. I also used a grid layout 
for its structure. Then I used CSS to style the calculator to make it similar to the styling of the calculators 
found on IOS phones. Next I used JavaScript to implement the calculator functionality. My first step was to 
make the numbers I clicked on display above the numbers. Then I implemented the functionality of being able to 
perform addition, multiplication, division, subtraction, clearing the screen, turning a number to a percentage, 
and turning the number to a positive or negative number. Next I implemented the functionality of being able to 
read keyboard inputs so that when I clicked the numbers and operators, the calculating functionality performs. 
I also added a delete feature so that when you hit the backspace button on the keyboard, the last number is 
deleted.

## Challenges Faced
One challenged I faced while doing this assignment was deleting an assignment-4 directory and not being 
able to push changes made to a new directory with the same name into the repository. How I overcame 
this was by trying possible things as well as googling possible solutions and trying them out. I 
was eventually able to solve the problem when I realized I was still in the directory path of 
assignment-4 in the terminal and I needed to move one folder back to be able to push the new assignment-4 
directory to the repository. Another challenge I faced was getting the compute function to work when I 
was doing the calculations through keyboard inputs. I solved this challenge by figuring out why the 
operators weren't being read when I pressed the keyboard and was able to solve if after
realizing that the operators from the keyboard inputs were not being assigned.

## Acknowledgement of Resources, Tutorials, and/or Code Snippets Used
I watched different YouTube videos on how to make a calculator using HTML, CSS, and Javascript while also
researching on the Google search engine why certain tags and attributes are used. I also researched
on how to implement javascript into the calculator functionality. I also utilized some code snippets provided 
from co-pilot and w3schools.com.
